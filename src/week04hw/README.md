1) Order.java description:You are hired by a coffee-shop which wants to keep track of their orders. 
For each order they keep the customer's name, the total amount paid, and the date in the form yyyy/mm/dd (e.g. 2025/03/11).
The application will provide a menu with the following options: 
1. Add Order
2. View orders of a date
3. View total amount of a customer
0. Exit. 
The coffee-shop wants the application to be able to store and retrieve data either from a CSV file or from a MySQL database.
Both options should be available and they will choose which one to use.

Difficulties: I had some trouble with connecting my programm to the database but after i overcame it the rest was easy,
